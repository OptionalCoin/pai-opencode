# Mission

**Your core life missions and purpose.**

Missions are your ultimate purposes - the "why" behind everything else in your TELOS system.

## Missions

### M0: AI-First Life System

**Timeline:** Ongoing - foundation for everything else

## Mission → Goal Mapping

| Mission | Goals | Status |

| M1 | G1, G4 | Next quarter focus |
| M2 | G2, G5 | Year-long focus |

## Mission Origins

My missions emerged from realizing that:

1. **AI is the ultimate leverage** - I can work 24/7 through AI systems
2. **Helping others scale better than helping myself** - creating value for others creates compound returns
3. **Systems beat efforts** - building something once and automating it forever is the path to freedom

The Jarvis PAI-OpenCode project represents the convergence of all three missions - it's both the tool I need and the product I can share.

## Mission Alignment Check

Before any major decision, ask:

- Does this move me closer to AI-first life? [Y/N]
- Does this create value I can share with others? [Y/N]
- Does this build toward automated systems? [Y/N]
- Would this help me help others succeed? [Y/N]

*Review quarterly. Missions should be stable - if they change frequently, go deeper.*
